INFORMATION:
    The program has a menu of options to choose from to test it. No input validation.

TESTS:                                                                      RESULTS:                 FIX:
    1) If dequeue function is called on an empty list                 ->    seg fault          ->    check for empty list
    2) If destroy function is called more than once                   ->    program crashes    ->    destroy and exit together
    3) If the integers entered are too big or too small               ->    overflow           ->    can't take too big or too small numbers
    4) If any function is sent a bad pionter                          ->    seg faults         ->    keep track of pointers
    5) Checking for memory leaks using Valgrind                       ->    no leaks found     ->    no fix needed
    6) If double or float is sent                                     ->    number truncated   ->    cannot take decimals, send only int
    7) If characters are put into the input menu                      ->    crashes            ->    check for characters
    
EXTRA NOTES:
    1) I did not have createQueue as an option in main because then I would have to keep track of more than one list.
